This directory contains all user-visible permissions declared
by the core CM platform and built-in applications for each platform
version.

The file can be generated by running the following command
on a freshly wiped device (that does not have any third party apps
installed):

adb shell pm list permissions -u -g | sort | grep "permission:cyanogenmod" | tr -d "\\r" > prebuilts/cmsdk/perm/NN.txt
