Yes... I feel your pain... but as a former first poster (I scored mine a
couple months ago) I know what you went through. Here's where you screwed
up though... YOU DIDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER. You didn't carpe diem.

Yep... When I saw that nice clean article with no posts I didn't hesitate,
yes the adrenaline was surging... my palms were wet, heart pounding. I was
standing at the peak of greatness... I knew I had but one thing to do,
there was no turning back now... I rapidly typed in a one word post.. then
with no hesitation I navigated my mouse over the submit button... and
WHAM.. seconds later I was looking at my feeble post with a #1 attached to
the header. At that mmoment I knew a feeling that only few will ever
know... I was at one with Slashdot... Zen masters and Kings will relate
I'm sure. That one sweet moment when the ying and the yang converge...
bliss... eternal bliss... ahhh! 

Then I smoked a cigarette and went to bed.

What If Bill Gates Was a Stand-Up Comedian? 

 1. None of his jokes would be funny.
 2. Subliminal message hyping Microsoft and Windows 98 would be inserted
    throughout his performance.
 3. The audio system (running Windows NT) would always crash right before Bill
    got to a punch line. At that time one of the managers would announce,
    "Please hold tight while we diagnose this intermittent issue."
 4. Tickets for Bill's show would be handed out for free in an attempt to
    attract customers away from Netscape's shows.
 5. Industry pundits would call Bill's show "innovative" and would ask "Why
    doesn't IBM have a stand-up routine? This is exactly why OS/2 is failing in
    the market."
 6. Bill's show would be called "ActiveHumor 98"
 7. In a perfect imitation of his Windows 95 OS, Bill wouldn't be able to tell
    a joke and walk around at the same time.
 8. Audience members would have to sign a License Agreement in which one of the
    terms is "I agree never to watch Linus Torvalds' show, 'GNU/Humorux'".
 9. All audience members would receive a free CD of Internet Explorer 4.0, with
    FakeJava(R) and ActiveHex(tm) technology.
10. Bill Gates would appear on Saturday Night Live, causing ratings to drop
    even further.

If Microsoft Owned McDonald's
Source: Unknown 

 1. Every order would come with fries whether you asked for them or not.
 2. When they introduce McPizza, the marketing makes it seem that they invented
    pizza.
 3. "A McDonald's on every block" -- Bill Gates.
 4. You'd be constantly pressured to upgrade to a more expensive burger.
 5. Sometimes you'll find that the burger box is empty. For some strange reason
    you'll accept this and purchase another one.
 6. They'd claim the burgers are the same size as at other fast food chains,
    but in reality it's just a larger bun hiding the small beef patty.
 7. Straws wouldn't be available until after you finish your drink.
 8. "Push" technology -- they have McD employees come to your door and sell you
    Happy Meals.
 9. Your order would never be right but the cash register would work perfectly
    for taking your money.
10. The "Special Sauce" cannot be reverse engineered, decompiled, or placed on
    more than 1 Big Mac.

You Might be a Microsoft Employee If...

 1. When a Microsoft program crashes for the millionth time, you say "Oh,
    well!" and reboot without any negative thoughts 
 2. The Windows 95 startup screen (the clouds) makes you feel all warm and
    fuzzy inside 
 3. You fully understand why Windows 95's Shutdown Option has to be
    accessed from the Start Menu 
 4. You believe Internet Explorer's security flaws were slipped in by a
    crack team of Netscape programmers 
 5. You keep valuable papers near your fireplace. Therefore, you are
    comfortable with Windows 95's "may-delete-it-at-anytime" philosophy 
 6. You're the Bob that Microsoft Bob was named after 
 7. Instead of "I'd rather be fishing," your bumper sticker says, "I'd
    rather be writing buggy Microsoft code" 
 8. You know the technical difference between OLE 1.0 and OLE 2.0

 3. Your favorite pick-up line is, "Hey baby...do you want to see a little
    ActiveX?"
 4. Everytime you see a website with "Best viewed with Netscape" on it you
    feel like filing a lawsuit against its webmaster
 5. You feel that all Anti-Microsoft websites should be censored because they
    are on the Internet, something Bill "invented." 
 6. You've set a goal to invent at least one new buzzword or acronym per day 
 7. You've ever been nervous because you haven't registered your Microsoft
    software yet. 
 8. You've trained your parrot to say "Unix sucks!" and "All hail Bill Gates!"
 9. You own a limited edition Monopoly game in which Boardwalk is Microsoft and

Hear me out. Linux is Microsoft's main competition right now. Because of
this we are forcing them to "innovate", something they would usually avoid. 
Now if MS Bob has taught us anything, Microsoft is not a company that
should be innovating. When they do, they don't come up with things like
"better security" or "stability", they come back with "talking
paperclips", and "throw in every usless feature we can think of, memory
footprint be dammed". 

Unfortunatly, they also come up with the bright idea of executing email.
Now MIME attachments aren't enough, they want you to be able to run/open
attachments right when you get them. This sounds like a good idea to
people who believe renaming directories to folders made computing possible
for the common man, but security wise it's like vigorously shaking a
package from the Unibomber. 

So my friends, we are to blame. We pushed them into frantically trying to
invent "necessary" features to stay on top, and look where it got us. Many
of us are watching our beloved mail servers go down under the strain and
rebuilding our company's PC because of our pointless competition with MS.
I implore you to please drop Linux before Microsoft innovates again.
